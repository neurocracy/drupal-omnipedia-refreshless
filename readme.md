Experimental support for the
[RefreshLess](https://www.drupal.org/project/refreshless) contributed module.

Provides an updated Drupal core patch and works around several issues:

* [composer.json still requires only Drupal 8, despite .info.yml allowing Drupal 9](https://www.drupal.org/project/refreshless/issues/3279394)

* [Add hook/event to alter cache contexts that RefreshLess considers sensitive to changes](https://www.drupal.org/project/refreshless/issues/3279949)

* [Consider attaching RefreshLess even when no session exists/user is anonymous](https://www.drupal.org/project/refreshless/issues/3279955)
